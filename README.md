# Arduino Flutter Demo APP -Distance Calculator using HC-SR04 Sensor
   https://prakash78blog.wordpress.com/2020/09/22/object-distance-measuring-app-using-arduino-and-flutter/
** Please prepare Arduino with a sample sketch shared here**
** Pair it with your smartphone with default password 1234 [this is for HC-05]**
** Build your Flutter app shared the main.dart and pubspec.yaml**

    ** How To***
      1 Wire your Arduio Uno (I used Clone) as per the given Sketch.
      2 Upload the Sketch to Arduino.
      3 Pair your HC-05 with your phone, default password is "1234"
      4 Build your app, shared the main.dart and yaml file, please keep minimum sdk as 19.
      5 Launch your app, ,make sure you have turned Bluetooth ON on your mobile and paired your HC-05.
      

 ***How it Works
     HC SR-04 is an unltrasonic sensor that sends the ultrasonic sound waves and calculates distance between the object from which waves got
     bounced back.
     HC-05 is the Bluetooth Module for Arduino.
